- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Abdelhadi (@0xc0Der). A self-taught developer. I have been self-teaching programming for 6+ years,
  and I have been enjoying doing it as a hobby since then, now I'm looking forward to "developing" it into a career.
  I love working on interesting projects and open source them.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Mathematics.

- fun fact: The first programming language I ever learned was C.
